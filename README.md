# Digital Audio Processors
  This repository contains different kinds of digital audio processors written in MATLAB. This is part one in a three-part series from a digital signal processing (DSP) design course. Part two is on [data compression](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Data-Compression), and part three is an [introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning). To see a detailed description and theory behind the design process, [click here](). Each .zip file contains all the files needed to run the program and a .pdf file called "Description and Theory", which contains the code in the appendix for those who don't have MATLAB installed. The theory assumes the reader has taken a course in linear signals and systems as well as the introductory topics of DSP, including block-by-block processing methods. Reading them in order will provide an introduction to sample-by-sample processing methods and optimization using circular delay line buffers, explaining the theory along the way.  Of course, if you just want the audio processors, feel free to use them.
