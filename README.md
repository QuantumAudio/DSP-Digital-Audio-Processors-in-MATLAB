# Digital-Audio-Processors
This repository contains different kinds of digital audio processors. They're written in MATLAB, which is a C-style language. Each .zip file contains all the files needed to run the program and a .pdf file called "Description and Theory", which contains the code in the appendix for those who don't have MATLAB installed. This is part one in a three-part series on DSP design. The theory assumes the reader has taken a course in linear signals and systems as well as the introductory topics of digital signal processing, including block-by-block processing methods. Reading them in order will provide an introduction to sample-by-sample processing methods and optimization using circular delay line buffers, explaining the theory along the way. Part two is on [Data Compression](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Data-Compression), and part three is an [introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning). Of course, if you just want the algorithms, feel free to use them.
