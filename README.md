# Digital Audio Processors
  This repository contains different kinds of digital audio processors written in MATLAB. This is part one in a three-part series from a digital signal processing (DSP) design course. Part two is on [data compression](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Data-Compression), and part three is an [introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning). To see a detailed description and theory behind the design processes, [click here](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/DSP_Design). Reading them in order will provide an introduction to sample-by-sample processing methods and optimization using circular delay line buffers.  Of course, if you just want the audio processors, feel free to use them. Each folder contains all program files and sample audio files when necessary.
